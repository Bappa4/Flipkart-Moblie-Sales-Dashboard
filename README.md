# 📱 Flipkart Mobile Sales Dashboard – A Power BI Storytelling Project
“Data is the new oil — and dashboards are the refineries that turn it into business gold.”

Welcome to the Flipkart Mobile Sales Dashboard — a deep dive into the digital shopping aisles of India’s leading e-commerce giant. This Power BI project transforms raw mobile phone listings into actionable insights for brands, analysts, and curious minds alike.

# 📖 The Story Behind the Dashboard
In India’s ever-evolving smartphone market, hundreds of brands compete for attention. From budget-friendly models to premium flagships, the variety is vast — but what actually drives sales? Which brands are winning across different price segments? And how do pricing strategies align with user ratings?

To answer these questions, I built a comprehensive, interactive dashboard using Flipkart mobile data. Think of it as a visual decision engine for e-commerce insights.
